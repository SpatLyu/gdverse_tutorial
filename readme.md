# gdverse: Spatial Stratified Heterogeneity Modeling in R

Welcome to the **gdverse_tutorial** repository â€“ your ultimate R package for spatial stratified heterogeneity modeling. This package is designed to measure spatial associations between variables and uncover the underlying spatial dependencies in your data.

With **gdverse**, you can explore how spatial stratified heterogeneity manifests in various contexts, making it an essential tool for analyzing geographic patterns in fields such as environmental studies, epidemiology, and urban geography. Whether you're investigating the relationship between environmental factors and health outcomes or exploring the spatial variability of socio-economic data, **gdverse** equips you with powerful tools to understand and quantify spatial associations.

Dive into the source code [here](https://github.com/stscl/gdverse), contribute, and unlock the full potential of spatial stratified heterogeneity analysis in your research. **gdverse** simplifies the process of measuring spatial associations, offering robust functions for modeling spatial stratified heterogeneity and visualizing the result.
